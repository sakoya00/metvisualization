*New York City's "Metropolitan Museum of Art," affectionately known as "the Met," is the largest art museum in America, and the fifth largest art museum in the world. With ggplotly, we created an interactive map which shows the expansiveness and diversity of the Met's collection. Almost 600,000 rows of data were combed through in order to present the attached visualization. Together, the data present an awe-inspiring look at the collection which the museum has accumulated over the years. See the interactive visualization at https://sakoya00.github.io/.*
