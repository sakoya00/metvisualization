# MetVisualization

*New York City's "Metropolitan Museum of Art," affectionately known as "the Met," is the largest art museum in America, and the fifth largest art museum in the world. With ggplotly, we created an interactive map which shows the expansiveness and diversity of the Met's collection. Almost 600,000 rows of data were combed through in order to present the attached visualization. Together, the data present an awe-inspiring look at the collection which the museum has accumulated over the years.*

##### Note: The viewer might notice that some countries or regions only have a few objects listed on the map. This can be attributed to any of a number of reasons, such as objects being repatriated to their country of origin, destruction of objects due to wars or conflicts, changing borders due to regime changes, widespread migrations of population, errors in the data, etc. These numbers are a consequence of the story of how the Met's collection came to be, and should not be narrowly interpreted to view any country or region in a negative light.
